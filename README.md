### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a professional game- and software engineer and former game engineering college professor, but I also love tinkering around with tech that I've built or bought.

Currently working with some great people on [Pixome](https://pixome.io).

And I'm making my own web-based massive multiplayer modular pixel art game engine named [Subako](https://subako.io) - it's already pretty much fully functional, now I just have to draw an entire game around it..
